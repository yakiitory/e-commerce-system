## Ethical Considerations

This admin panel is designed with ethics in mind:

✅ **User Privacy**: View only necessary information
✅ **Transparency**: All actions are logged and visible
✅ **Safeguards**: Multiple confirmations for destructive actions
✅ **Accountability**: Admin actions are tied to specific accounts
✅ **Data Protection**: Secure password handling and storage
✅ **Fair Access**: Role-based permissions prevent abuse

❌ **Does NOT allow**:
- Viewing user passwords (stored as hashes)
- Unauthorized data modification
- Accessing private messages or personal files
- Bypassing payment systems
- Fraudulent transactions

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Database
```
Error: Failed to create connection pool
Solution: Check your .env file and database credentials
```

### Permission Denied
```
Error: Access denied. Superadmin only.
Solution: Log in with a superadmin account or contact your superadmin
```

### Invalid Input
```
Error: Invalid ID. Please enter a number.
Solution: Ensure you're entering numeric IDs where required
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check system statistics daily
2. **User Verification**: Always verify user/merchant identity before suspensions
3. **Order Reviews**: Review cancelled orders for fraud patterns
4. **Admin Access**: Limit superadmin accounts to trusted personnel
5. **Password Security**: Use strong passwords and change them regularly
6. **Backup First**: Consider database backups before bulk deletions

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Ensure proper admin permissions
4. Review the system logs
